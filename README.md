## Description

The idea is to create a custom ECS framework that is entirely based on ScriptableObjects. This will allow for a more data-driven approach to game development, and will allow for a more modular and flexible codebase.

### Actor

An Actor is an entity in the game world.

### Component

A Component is a ScriptableObject that contains data.

### System

A System is a ScriptableObject that contains logic.~~~~

## Installation

Simply clone the repository and import the "BorysACS" folder into your Unity project's Assets folder.
